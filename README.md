# Windows 9

**Windows 9** is a fictional, web-based operating system interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by classic versions of Windows like 7, XP, and even 10, this project imagines what **Windows 9** might have looked like ‚Äî if it had ever officially existed.

This project recreates the feel of a real desktop environment directly in your browser, complete with icons, a taskbar, start menu, draggable windows, and interactive apps.
